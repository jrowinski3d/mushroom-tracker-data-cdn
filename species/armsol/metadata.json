  "description": "Western Honey Mushroom has a brown to reddish-brown cap (5-15 cm) covered with small DARK BROWN SCALES, especially at center - often more reddish tones than eastern species. Gills are white to cream, attached, staining brown. The stem has a PERSISTENT RING and SOLID, FIRM texture (hence 'solidipes'). Stem is whitish above ring, brownish below with scales. Grows in LARGE DENSE CLUSTERS on conifers. Flesh is white, very firm. Spore print is white. Black rhizomorphs present. VERY AGGRESSIVE tree pathogen in western forests.",
  "habitat": "Parasitic and saprobic on CONIFERS in western North America, especially Douglas fir, true firs, pines, and hemlocks. Grows in massive clusters at base of living or dead trees. One of the most destructive forest pathogens in the Pacific Northwest, causing extensive root rot.",
  "season": "Fall (September-November), with peak fruiting after fall rains.",
  "regions": [
    "Pacific Northwest",
    "British Columbia",
    "Northern California",
    "Rocky Mountains",
    "Alaska"

  "lookalikes": [
    "Armillaria ostoyae - very similar, darker scales, slightly different range",
    "Other Armillaria species - all require cooking",
    "Pholiota species - brown spores",
    "Galerina species - DEADLY - smaller, brown spores"
  ],
  "safety_notes": "EDIBLE WITH CAUTION: Honey mushrooms (Armillaria species) are POISONOUS when raw and must be thoroughly cooked before consumption. Cook for at least 10-15 minutes at high heat. Even when properly cooked, some individuals experience allergic reactions or digestive upset. Try a small amount first to test your tolerance. Parboiling before cooking can help reduce gastrointestinal irritants and bitter taste. Do not consume with alcohol - honey mushrooms can cause adverse reactions when combined with alcohol (similar to Coprinopsis). Collect only young, firm specimens.",
