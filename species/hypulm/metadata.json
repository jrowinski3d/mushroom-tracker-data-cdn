  "description": "White to cream-colored caps 2-6 inches wide with smooth to slightly hairy surface. Unlike true oyster mushrooms, has a more central to slightly off-center stem 2-4 inches long. White decurrent gills. Often grows in small clusters high on living or recently dead hardwood trees. White spore print.",
  "habitat": "Saprobic and parasitic on living and dead hardwood trees, particularly elm, box elder, maple, and aspen. Typically fruits high up on tree trunks, often 10-40 feet above ground. Common on standing trees in urban and forest settings. Causes white rot of heartwood.",

  "lookalikes": [
    "Pleurotus ostreatus (lateral/absent stem, more oyster-shaped)",
    "Pleurotus populinus (no central stem, on aspen/cottonwood)",
    "Angel wings (Pleurocybella porrigens) - toxic, pure white, on conifers",
    "Armillaria species (has ring on stem, yellowish colors)"
  ],
  "safety_notes": "EDIBLE: Good edible mushroom with firm texture and mild flavor when young. Cook thoroughly before eating. Older specimens can become tough and are best avoided. The central stem and high growth position on trees help distinguish it from Pleurotus species. Related to cultivated Hon-shimeji (H. tessulatus) grown commercially.",
