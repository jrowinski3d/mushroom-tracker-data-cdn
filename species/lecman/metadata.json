  "description": "The Manzanita Bolete features a reddish-brown to dark brown cap (5-15 cm) with dry, velvety to smooth surface. Pores are white when young, aging to olive-gray, bruising brownish. The whitish to pale brown stem is covered with brown to dark brown scabers (rough scales). White flesh stains pinkish-brown when cut, eventually darkening to gray. Spore print is olive-brown.",
  "habitat": "Mycorrhizal exclusively with manzanita (Arctostaphylos species) in chaparral and mixed oak-madrone forests. Forms obligate associations with manzanita shrubs. Found in coastal forests and foothill woodlands with manzanita understory.",
  "season": "Winter through spring (December-April) with peak fruiting in January-March. Unusual winter fruiting period associated with California rainy season.",
  "regions": [
    "California Coast Ranges",
    "Northern California",
    "Central California",
    "San Francisco Bay Area",
    "Sierra Nevada foothills",
    "Southern Oregon"
  ],
  "lookalikes": [
    "Other Leccinum species - but different tree associations",
    "Boletus species - lack the scabrous stem",
    "Leccinum aurantiacum - more orange cap, different habitat",
    "Suillus species - viscid cap, conifer association"
  ],
  "safety_notes": "EDIBLE: Manzanita Bolete is a good edible with firm texture. Must be cooked thoroughly for at least 15-20 minutes. The unique manzanita association and winter fruiting period distinguish it from other boletes. Flesh darkening is normal and safe.",
