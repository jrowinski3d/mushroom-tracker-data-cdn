  "common_name": "Variable-stalk Bolete",
  "edibility": "E",
  "description": "The Two-colored Bolete features a reddish to pinkish-brown cap (5-15 cm) with smooth to wrinkled surface. Pores are yellow, instantly bruising blue when touched - a dramatic reaction. The yellow stem with reddish base displays reticulation and bruises blue-green. Yellow flesh immediately stains deep blue when cut, one of the most dramatic bluing reactions among boletes. Spore print is olive-brown.",
  "habitat": "Mycorrhizal with oak, beech, and other hardwoods in mixed deciduous forests. Prefers acidic soils and well-established forest systems. Common in mature hardwood stands.",
  "season": "Summer through fall (June-October) with peak fruiting in late summer. Fruits during warm, humid periods following rainfall.",
  "regions": [
    "Eastern North America",
    "Northeastern United States",
    "Appalachian region",
    "Great Lakes states",
    "Mid-Atlantic forests",
    "Southeastern hardwood forests"
  ],
  "lookalikes": [
    "Boletus edulis - no bluing, white pores, different cap color",
    "Boletus subcaerulescens - less dramatic bluing reaction",
    "Tylopilus felleus - pink pores, no bluing, bitter",
    "Boletus sensibilis - extreme bluing, different stature"
  ],
  "safety_notes": "EDIBLE: Two-colored Bolete is a good edible with mild flavor and firm texture. The dramatic blue-staining reaction is completely normal and safe - it does NOT indicate toxicity. Some people may experience digestive upset. The striking bluing and two-toned stem (yellow/red) are diagnostic features. Always cook thoroughly.",
