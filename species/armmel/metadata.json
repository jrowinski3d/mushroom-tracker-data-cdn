Even when properly cooked, some individuals experience allergic reactions or digestive upset. Try a small amount first to test your tolerance. Parboiling before cooking can help reduce gastrointestinal irritants and bitter taste. Do not consume with alcohol - honey mushrooms can cause adverse reactions when combined with alcohol (similar to Coprinopsis). Collect only young, firm specimens.",
