  "description": "The Parasol Mushroom is a large, impressive species with a distinctive umbrella-shaped cap reaching 10-30 cm across, covered in upturned brown scales on a cream background forming a snakeskin pattern. The cap is mounted on a tall slender stem (15-35 cm) with a thick double-edged movable ring and brown snake-like scaly patterns below the ring. The gills are free (not attached to stem), white becoming cream with age, and crowded. The white flesh has a mild nutty flavor and does not bruise or change color when cut.",
  "habitat": "Found in grassy areas including pastures, meadows, lawn edges, woodland clearings, parks, and roadsides. Grows terrestrially (not on wood) in nutrient-rich soil, often in disturbed areas. Typically fruits scattered or in small groups, sometimes in fairy rings. Prefers areas with moderate sun exposure and well-drained soil.",
  "season": "Summer through fall (July-November in North America, May-November in warmer climates). Peak fruiting occurs in late summer to early fall, particularly after warm rains. In Mediterranean climates may fruit spring and fall.",

  "lookalikes": [
    "Chlorophyllum brunneum (toxic) - greenish spore print, reddens when cut, stockier build",
    "Chlorophyllum molybdites (toxic) - green spores, greens when bruised, North American",
    "Lepiota species (some deadly) - much smaller (<10 cm cap), fragile ring",
    "Amanita species (deadly) - volva at base, gills attached or free but with volva"
  ],
  "safety_notes": "CHOICE EDIBLE: One of the finest edible mushrooms with firm texture and nutty flavor. The cap is preferred (stem is fibrous). Cook thoroughly - do not eat raw. Critical identification: verify FREE white gills (not attached to stem), MOVABLE thick double-edged ring, snakeskin scaly stem, WHITE spore print, NO volva at base. Discard the tough fibrous stem. Some people report mild digestive upset - try small amounts first. The parasol must be clearly distinguished from toxic Chlorophyllum species which have greenish spores.",
