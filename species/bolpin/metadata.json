  "description": "The Pine Bolete features a dark reddish-brown to mahogany cap (7-30 cm) with smooth to slightly sticky surface when wet. Pores are white when young, aging to yellow-olive, with no bruising. The robust stem is reddish-brown with white to pinkish reticulation, often with vinaceous (wine-red) tones. White flesh may show slight pinkish tinge under cap cuticle but does not stain when cut. Spore print is olive-brown.",
  "habitat": "Mycorrhizal with pine, spruce, and other conifers in montane and subalpine coniferous forests. Prefers acidic soils and higher elevations. Often fruits in large numbers under mature conifers.",
  "season": "Late summer through fall (July-October), with peak fruiting in August-September at higher elevations. Appears after sustained rainfall during warm weather.",

  "lookalikes": [
    "Boletus edulis - lighter cap color, less reddish tones",
    "Boletus aereus - darker cap, prefers oak not pine",
    "Tylopilus felleus - pink pores, bitter taste",
    "Other reddish Boletus species - all edible"
  ],
  "safety_notes": "CHOICE EDIBLE: Pine Bolete is considered by many to be the best tasting of all boletes, with rich, nutty flavor and firm texture. Highly prized for drying, as flavor intensifies. The reddish-brown coloration and pine association are key identification features. Always cook thoroughly.",
