  "description": "The Aspen Scaber Stalk displays an orange-red to brick-red cap (5-18 cm) with dry, slightly velvety texture. Pores are white when young, aging to dingy gray-brown, bruising brownish. The white to yellowish stem is densely covered with orange-brown to reddish-brown scabers (rough scales). White flesh stains pinkish to wine-red when cut, eventually darkening to purple-gray or black. Spore print is olive-brown.",
  "habitat": "Mycorrhizal exclusively with aspen trees (Populus tremuloides) in montane and subalpine forests. Forms obligate associations with quaking aspen. Common in aspen groves at higher elevations.",
  "season": "Summer through fall (July-September) with peak fruiting in August at higher elevations. Appears after monsoon rains in mountain aspen forests.",

  "lookalikes": [
    "Leccinum aurantiacum - similar appearance, also with aspen",
    "Other Leccinum species - stem scabers are distinctive",
    "Boletus species - lack rough stem scales",
    "Suillus species - viscid cap, different habitat"
  ],
  "safety_notes": "EDIBLE: Aspen Scaber Stalk is a good edible with firm texture. Must be cooked thoroughly for at least 20 minutes - undercooked specimens can cause digestive upset. The dramatic flesh color changes are normal and safe. Most common in southwestern mountain aspen forests.",
