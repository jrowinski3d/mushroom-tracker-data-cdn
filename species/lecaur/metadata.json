  "description": "The Red-capped Scaber Stalk features a distinctive orange to reddish-orange cap (5-20 cm) with dry to slightly tacky surface. Pores are white when young, aging to grayish, bruising brownish. The tall, white stem is covered with dark brown to blackish scabers (rough scales) - a diagnostic feature. White flesh stains pink to reddish when cut, aging to gray or black. Spore print is olive-brown.",
  "habitat": "Mycorrhizal exclusively with aspen and poplar trees in mixed forests. Forms obligate associations with Populus species. Found in aspen groves, riparian areas with cottonwood, and mixed aspen-conifer forests.",
  "season": "Summer through fall (June-October) with peak fruiting in July-August. Often appears soon after summer rains in aspen habitats.",

    "Great Lakes region",
    "Northeastern forests with aspen",

  "lookalikes": [
    "Leccinum insigne - orange-red cap, similar habitat with aspen",
    "Other Leccinum species - stem scabers distinguish from Boletus",
    "Boletus species - lack the distinctive scabrous stem",
    "Lactarius species - have gills not pores, produce latex"
  ],
  "safety_notes": "EDIBLE: Red-capped Scaber Stalk is a good edible with firm texture, though not as highly prized as King Bolete. Must be cooked thoroughly - can cause digestive upset if undercooked or eaten raw. Flesh darkening is normal. The orange cap and rough-scaled stem are diagnostic features.",
