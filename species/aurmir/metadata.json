  "description": "The Admirable Bolete features a distinctive dark reddish-brown to burgundy cap (5-20 cm) with velvety, dry surface. Pores are bright golden-yellow, bruising blue-green. The yellow stem displays burgundy-red tones and has distinctive yellow reticulation. Yellow flesh stains blue when cut. Often grows on decaying hemlock wood - a unique habitat among boletes. Spore print is olive-brown.",
