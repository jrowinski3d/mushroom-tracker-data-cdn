  "description": "The Spring King Bolete displays a pinkish-brown to reddish-brown cap (5-25 cm) with smooth, often wrinkled surface when mature. Pores are white when young, becoming yellowish with age, showing no bruising reaction. The thick, white stem has white reticulation and often shows pinkish-red tones at the base. White flesh is firm and does not stain when cut. Spore print is olive-brown.",
  "habitat": "Mycorrhizal with pine, Douglas fir, and other conifers in low to mid-elevation forests. Associated with snowmelt and spring moisture. Prefers sandy or gravelly soils under mature conifers.",
  "season": "Spring through early summer (April-July), with peak fruiting in May-June. Known as 'Spring King' for early seasonal appearance, often fruiting when snow is still present at higher elevations.",
