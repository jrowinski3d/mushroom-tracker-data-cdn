  "safety_notes": "EDIBLE WITH CAUTION: Honey mushrooms (Armillaria species) are POISONOUS when raw and must be thoroughly cooked before consumption. Cook for at least 10-15 minutes at high heat. Even when properly cooked, some individuals experience allergic reactions or digestive upset. Try a small amount first to test your tolerance. Parboiling before cooking can help reduce gastrointestinal irritants and bitter taste. Do not consume with alcohol - honey mushrooms can cause adverse reactions when combined with alcohol (similar to Coprinopsis). Collect only young, firm specimens.",
